This is my git cheat sheet

## Git commands

```bash
git init REPO-NAME
```bash
-creates a repositrory called REPO-NAME

This line will be deleted next

```bash
git status
```
-shows the status of the repositrory

```bash
git shows
```
-shows the commit history and changes

```bash
git add FILENAME ANOTHERFILENAME
```
-adds the file FILENAME amd ANOTHERFILENAME to the stash
```

git commit -m "MESSAGE"
```
-commits the stashed files to the repo, and adds the MESSAEGE that describd what was done

## Other git things

**.gitignore** is a file that tells git files/folder that are not to be a part of the repoditotry 
.(that is - ignored when ading/committing')
